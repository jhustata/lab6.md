### 1. Data
[strpos.csv](strpos.csv)     
I can't directly access the uploaded "stsrpos.csv" file. However, I'll create a Python script to read and analyze this CSV file. Let me read the file and extract key details to prepare specific homework questions for your students.

Hereâ€™s an overview of the "stsrpos.csv" dataset you provided:

- **usrds_id**: This column appears to represent unique identifiers for the data entries.
- **gnn**: This column seems to represent the name of a drug or generic drug name.
- **srvc_dt**: This column contains dates associated with the data, formatted as `ddmmmyyyy`.

### Sample Questions for Homework

Based on this data structure, you can consider the following homework questions:

1. **Unique Drugs:** Write a command that identifies the unique generic drug names (`gnn`) in the dataset. How many unique drugs are there? Print the names of the drugs.

2. **Common Drugs:** Write a command to identify which generic drug names are the most common across the dataset. Display the top 10 drugs along with their frequency counts.

3. **Service Date Analysis:** Convert the `srvc_dt` column to a Stata-readable date format. Write a command to determine the earliest and latest dates in the dataset.

4. **Drug Use Over Time:** Create a variable that extracts the year from the `srvc_dt` column. Write a command that summarizes the number of times each drug (`gnn`) was recorded each year. Display this information in a table.

5. **Drug Use Patterns:** Write a command that identifies which drugs were administered in the same month. Display this information as a table, showing the `usrds_id`, `gnn`, and `srvc_dt` for each matching month.

6. **Drug Frequency:** Write a command to identify patients (`usrds_id`) who have been administered the same drug (`gnn`) more than once. Display the patient IDs, drug names, and the respective dates of administration.
### 2. Code
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset to examine its structure
file_path = '/mnt/data/stsrpos.csv'
dataset = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows and column names
dataset.head(), dataset.columns

```
```txt
